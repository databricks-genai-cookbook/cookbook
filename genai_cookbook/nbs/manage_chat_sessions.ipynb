    "# Managing Chat Sessions with the Python SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing chat sessions is an essential part of creating effective conversational AI experiences. Chat sessions help to ensure that LLMs have access to past user inputs and responses, letting the model keep the conversation flowing and context-rich. This notebook demonstrates how the `ChatSession` class in the Python SDK streamlines this, ensuring your AI chat feels more like a natural back-and-forth. It also outlines how to create a custom chat management system if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the `ChatSession` class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChatSession` class in the Foundation Model API Python SDK makes it easy to manage chat histories without impementing a lot of custom code. Managing a chat session involves three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the `ChatSession` object with e.g. `chat = ChatSession(model=mixtral-8x7b-instruct, system_message=\"you are a helpful assistant\")`.\n",
    "2. Use the `reply` method to send user replies to the model.\n",
    "3. Use the `last` method to get the last response from the model.\n",
