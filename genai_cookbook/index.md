# Databricks Mosaic Generative AI Cookbook

## RAG Guide
Follow this guide to learn how RAG works, the required components of a production-ready, high-quality RAG application, and Databricksâ€™ recommended developer workflow for delivering a high-quality RAG application that uses unstructured data.  

This guide assumes you have selected a use case that requires unstructured docs RAG.

This guide is broken into 5 main sections:

1. Introduction to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
   a. Overview of the RAG technique 
   b. Key benefits of using RAG
   c. Types of RAG
2. Fundamentals of RAG over Unstructured Documents 
   a. Understanding retrieval
   b. Components of a RAG application
3. Deep dive into RAG over Unstructured Documents
   a. Deep dive into the components of a RAG application
4. How to evaluate RAG applications
   a. Metrics to measure quality / cost / latency
   b. Developing an evaluation set to measure quality
   c. Infrastructure required to evaluate RAG apps
5. Practical hands-on guide to implementing high-quality RAG
   a. Databricks recommended developer workflow for building a RAG application 
   b. How to iteratively improve the application's quality
   c. Throughout, this section is supported by ready-to-use code examples

If you are less familiar with RAG, we suggest starting with section 1. If you are already familiar with RAG or simply want to get started quickly, start with section 5.  Section 5 refers back to the previous sections as needed to explain concepts.
