# Retrieval Augmented Generation

Please visit http://ai-cookbook.io for the accompanying documentation for this repo.

This repo provides production-ready code to build a **high-quality RAG application** using Databricks.  This repo complements the  [Mosaic Generative AI Cookbook]() which provides:
  - A conceptual overview and deep dive into various Generative AI design patterns, such as Prompt Engineering, Agents, RAG, and Fine Tuning
  - An overview of Evaluation-Driven development
  - The theory of every parameter/knob that impacts quality
  - How to root cause quality issues and detemermine which knobs are relevant to experiment with for your use case
  - Best practices for how to experiment with each knob

This repo is intended for use with the Databricks platform.  Specifically:
- [Mosaic AI Agent Framework]() which provides a fast developer workflow with enterprise-ready LLMops & governance
- [Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation]() which provides reliable, quality measurement using proprietary AI-assisted LLM judges to measure quality metrics that are powered by human feedback collected through an intuitive web-based chat UI
